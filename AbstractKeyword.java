//Abstract is applicable for methods and classes
//in real life abstract means : partially complete 

//abstract method 
//--> the abstract method has only declaration not implementation 
//--> child classes are responsible for provide implementation
//--> every abstract method should be implemented by child classes
//e.g. taste method of fruit  : what is test of the fruit

//if class contain at least one abstract method then class should be abstract
//but an abstract class contain zero no. of abstract method also


//abstract class : class which is partially implemented called abstract class
// partially implemented means contains abstract method
//not possible to create object of abstract class
//as abstract class is partially implemented i.e. method is not implemented so not possible to create an object of abstract class
