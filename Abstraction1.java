//In Java, a class cannot extend more than one class. Therefore following is illegal âˆ’

//Example :  public class extends Animal, Mammal{}

//However, a class can implement one or more interfaces, which has helped Java get rid of the impossibility of multiple inheritances.
//
//The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity.
//
//Consider a case where class B extends class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display().
//
//Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation, multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.
